import MdxLayout from "../../components/mdx-layout";
import Head from 'next/head'

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  const headtitle= "Pre-Rendering"
  return (<>
    <MdxLayout>
        <Head><title>{headtitle}</title></Head>
    <div className="text-justify">
      {children}
    </div> 
    </MdxLayout>
    </>
  );
}

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

```javascript
// Empower your performance testing arsenal with this JavaScript 
// function for calculating standard deviation
const calculateStandardDeviation = (data) => {
  const mean = data.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0) / data.length;
  const squaredDifferences = data.map((val) => Math.pow(val - mean, 2));
  const meanSquaredDifferences =
    squaredDifferences.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0) / data.length;
  return Math.sqrt(meanSquaredDifferences);
};
```

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
