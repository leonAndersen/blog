## How to build a "sticky footer" for your WebApp | CSS Height & Positioning

<div className="text-neutral-400 text-sm">

Do you want to build a footer that stays at the bottom of your screen or lower -
depending on the main content size? Well, CSS height might confuse your deepest
beliefs about reality in the process! It's a common webdeveloper joke, that CSS
height is the hardest part of programming. But fear not, you will likely find
your solution in this article.

### 1. Common Attempts & Solution

Ok, first of all, let's assume your situation is similar to this basic html structure:

```js
<Html>
  <body>
    <div aria-label="Main Layout">
      <header></header>
      <main></main>
      <footer></footer>
    </div>
  </body>
</Html>
```
#### What does not work (Common Attempts):

- `<main className="h-screen">` (height: 100vh)
  - `<main>` is now as high, as the screen which means it pushes the footer out of the viewport
- `<main className="h-full">` (height: 100%)
  - nothing happens: the parent elements limit `main` (child) to the size of its contents, via their default `h-auto` (height: auto)
  - if you set *all* parents to `h-full`, you get the same "push-out" problem as with `h-screen`

#### What does work (Solution):
```js
<Html>
  <body>
    // min-height: 100dvh; display: flex; flex-direction: column;
    <div className="min-h-dvh flex flex-col">
      <header></header>
      // flex-grow: 1;
      <main className="grow"></main>
      <footer></footer>
    </div>
  </body>
</Html>
```


`min-h-dvh` sets the minimum height of the container (parent of main). 

Instead of using `min-h-screen` (min-height: 100vh) we use "dvh - dynamic
viewport height" to ensure mobile-screens substract the browserbar from the
screen-height, which would otherwise push out the footer aswell.

`flex` `flex-col` sets the container to be a flexbox in column direction. (You
want header, main, footer to be stacked ontop of, not besides each other.)

And `grow` sets `<main>` to fill out as much of the free space in the parent
flexbox container as possible. `<header>` and `<footer>` should not have `grow` in this case, or they compete for the space.

### CSS Debugging Strategies

If the above solution did not fit your situtation, or if you are curious on how
to faster find solutions by yourself, I'll show you 2 approaches that helped me
a lot: The Multifile Overview and the Blank Slate.

#### The Multifile Overview

This might be basic to many, but sometimes all you need is a focused overview
about all hmtl tags and classes involved, which are spread over different files.
The fastest way I found is to:

- open dev tools element view as wide as possible,
- open just enough parents to reveal only the tags that are relevant to your situation,
- screenshot that overview,
- and cross out all left over distractions with your screenshot/ image tool. 
  - for example leave only classes related to height and positioning

This takes 2 minutes and helps you to get clear of the css relationships even
after long sessions of confusing trial and error:


<Image src={cssOverview} alt="the previously described crossed out screenshot"/>

Of course you can type that out instead or just cross out in your mind
while looking at the devtools. 

If you have a big enough screen, also make sure to open all component files
besides each other (multiple split editors), in parent to child order.

#### The Blank Slate

Another great way for clarity is to just build everything from scratch...almost.
Of course you can keep everything that you've built. Just `git add .` `git
commit` `git checkout -b blank-slate` and delete everything except for

- x understand this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sF5KsEo6gM + summary here?
- understand overview
  - order first, later get internet to check unneccessary
  - y makes sense to explain functionality of different classes in overview?
  - compare similar levels ? eg header, footer; index.js, MdxLayout.js
- re-build from scratch
  - minimize amount of tags afterwards
- otherwise try grid link https://css-tricks.com/how-to-use-css-grid-for-sticky-headers-and-footers/
