## How to Code a Blog in 2024 <br/>(with MDX and Next14 Pages-Routing)

</div>

Welcome to the step-by-step guide of how you can build a blog-website just
like this - using React, Tailwind, NextJS, MDX and MailChimp.

**Why use pages routing in 2024/ Next14?** Eventhough NextJS is nudging everyone
to use App-Routing, at work you will likely encounter older projects that still
use pages routing. It's a valuable skill to know the legacy ways. 

**Why MDX with pages routing?** Besides interactive React components in your
articles: In pages routing you can route with your blog-post-title.mdx files,
and render them as pages directly without needing to parse them through the
usual [slug/id].js file. This way you also don't need getStaticRoutes.

To build this setup, I had to pick pieces from many different tutorials. 
In this guide I bring it all together.

<a id="prerequisites"></a>
### [Prerequisites](#toc)

If you are a complete beginner at coding, first work through something like the Webdeveloper Bootcamp by Colt Steele. That's what gave me the foundations for this blog project *(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)*.

For learning *Tailwind*, scan through [this](https://www.youtube.com) short tutorial on 1.5-2x speed. 
Then learn to actually use it by building your own blog with it. 
With Tailwind-Docs-Search and ChatGPT, this is fun and easy. 
Except for some basic CSS overview, I had almost zero experience with it before this blog.

For the harder part of styling - positioning and responsive design - I also
wrote intructions later in this article. Additionally you can find all
_tailwind-classes_ that I used in my [source code]() on Github.

If you are new to to *Github/* version control: Work through [this]() Git Crash Course. And make sure to read through *[conventional commits]()*.

_Accessibility_ is not my strength yet, so I only adress a few of its aspects in this guide. If you want to go deeper on it, my mentor recommends [this resource.]() 

IMPORTANT: Before starting your blog project, I can also recommend to watch
[this]() little _NextJS_ course on 1.5-2x speed (no need to code along there imo). This
will give you a workable overview of the NextJS basics.

## <a id="vision-scope" href="#prep-and-setup"> Vision/ Scope </a>

### <a id="modeling" href="#prep-and-setup">Modeling</a>
If you want to build websites as cool as your idols - steal from them. 
Seriously, everything is a remix. Pick whatever sparks your fire, even outside the box of websites.

I stole from:

- bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com (main content width and breath)
  - <Image src={bettermf}  alt=""/>
- nav.al (subscribeform in header)
  - <Image src={naval}  alt=""/>
- overreacted.io (header content centered and colorfulness)
  - <Image src={overreacted}  alt=""/>
- AbletonLive Music Production Suite (tag colors I used in my producer days)
  - <Image src={ableton}  alt=""/>

### <a id="drafting" href="#prep-and-setup">Drafting</a>
#### Visual
Draft out the design first. At least roughly. Positioning, proportions,
colortheme, font vibe, most important elements and pages. I used Photoshop, but Gimp or
even pen and paper could do. IMPORTANT: Also draft out how it should look on mobile aswell!

Knowing precisely what I wanted to build, and seeing it almost alive from the start, felt really helpful to me.
This kept me motivated and always clear about the next steps.

It is also a good measurement of how closely you can create what you (or your designers) have planned.
Of course you can keep happy accidents, but don't take them as an excuse to not create and learn what you wanted to in the first place.

I am pretty proud of how close I got:
	
<Image src={homepagedraft}  alt="my draft for the homepage"/>
*(my first Photoshop draft of the homepage)*

#### Written

Brainstorm notes of all the elements, features and effects you want as bulletpoints.

Include stuff that you are not sure about. Just tag that with question marks. 
Sort and trim later.

Use these notes and this article as the source for your to do lists.


### <a id="mockup-content" href="#prep-and-setup">Mock Up content</a>

Create placeholder articles and other page content using the LLM of your choice. 

It's easy and makes the building process more fun and realistic.

Here are the prompts I used:

- generate 5 interesting article titles for my dev blog
- format as previews, including a random date and a preview sentence
- write out the first one as a full article including code examples
- write me a short about page

### <a id="component-plan" href="#prep-and-setup">Component Plan</a> 

Brainstorm a list of all the major (react-) components and pages you will likely need to build, like this:

- HomeFeed (index/ home) 
- Header
- Footer
- Menu
- Layout (main template)
- SubcribeForm (header, footer, menu, onpage)
- About
- 404


## <a id="setup" href="#prep-and-setup">Setup</a>

### <a id="installation" href="#prep-and-setup">Installation</a>

- install and run the NextJS project as described in the [NextJS docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation):
  
  0. install Node.js and npm
  1. `npx create-next-app@latest` 
  2. Initial Settings:
    - What is your project named? **blog**
    - Would you like to use TypeScript? **No** / Yes
    - Would you like to use ESLint? **No** / Yes
    - Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / **Yes**
    - Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / **Yes**
    - Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) **No** / Yes
    - Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? **No** / Yes
  3. `cd blog`
  4. `npm run dev`
  5. open http://localhost:3000/ in the browser (chrome/ brave)
- delete all unneccessary components of the NextJS default template
  - `git branch empty-template` to save this as a canvas for css experiments later in the process

### <a id="routing" href="#prep-and-setup">Routing</a>

NextJS pages-routing in a nutshell:

<div className="prose-pre:leading-4 prose-pre:bg-neutral-800">
```
prettier-ignore

src/
├── components
├── pages/
│   ├── api
│   ├── posts/ 
│   │   └── blog-titles.mdx   // auto-routed to .com/posts/filename (+ collected for feedData.js utility)
│   ├── _app.js
│   ├── _document.js
│   ├── 404.js                // auto-routed and hooked up as 404 via reserved filename 
│   ├── about.js              // .js (and .mdx!) in pages/ get auto-routed to .com/filename
│   └── index.js              // auto-routed as .com/ via reserved filename 
├── styles
├── utils/
│   ├── feedData.js           // (getStaticProps: fetches blogfeed preview data from ./pages/posts to index.js)
│   └── ...
└── ...
```
</div>

NextJS PR determines the URL path of your different pages by their position in the folders and a set of special purpose filenames.
Make sure to use this exact folder structure and the rules described in the comments.

Action Steps:
- create all of the component and page files from the component list
- place them in their routing as described above
  - no need for feedData.js and getStaticProps yet
  - components like Footer.js belong into the component folder
- the files can be empty but should have the rightjj filenames and folderpositions
  - you can already paste your mockup article texts into your .mdx files though
- test if the routes exist, by typing them in the URL bar of the browser
  - congrats, you now understand the pages-routing basics, let's learn how to build on top of that in the main building section

<br/>
## <a id="main-building" href="#toc">Main Building</a>

### <a id="html-overview" href="#main-building">HTML Overview</a>

Before we go into the components, there are a few HTML concepts you should keep in mind for the project:

1. **overview**

You can see that there are 3 layers of nesting in a NextJS PR project:
- the "HTML base layer" (document)
- the "layout and settings layer" (app)
- and finally the individual pages

<div className="prose-pre:leading-4">
```js caption="note: this is pseudo code, the tags are spread over different files, and the <Main/> and <Component/> tags are not two-parted"

<Html>                             // _document.js
<body>
<Main>
        <Layout>                   // _app.js
        <MDXProvider>
        <Component>
                    (<MDXLayout>)  // page files (.js = without MDXLayout)
                     <main>    

                     </main>    
                    (</MDXLayout>)
        </Component>
        </MDXProvider>  
        </Layout>
</Main>
</body>
</Html>

```
</div>


Having this overview helps to structure your (Tailwind-)CSS stylings in the
correct order of nesting, and detect conflicting classes. This is crucial for
the usually cumbersome CSS positioning, which I go into later.

2. `<main>`

Notice the `<Main/>`tag in the base and the `<main></main>` in the page layer.
The first is the Main of the whole app and the second represents the mains of
the individual pages. 

No tutorial stressed out the role of the `<main></main>` tag to me - or let alone
that every page needs one. Well, it turns out, besides CSS clarity, it is
essential for accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).

I only knew that you should often use descriptive tags like `<section>` instead of `<div>`, but I
wasn't aware of the best practice `<main>`-structure, until my mentor pointed it
out to me... and now you know it too: 

**main tag rules**

- every page needs a `<main>` as its highest parent
- `<article>` tags are important (eg. for RSS), but they don't replace the role of the `<main>` and should be nested inside of it
- only have one `<main>` per page/ DOM-tree
  - make sure to check for "doubles" through all layers via the devtools elements section
    - don't worry, the NextJS `<Main/>` tag does not appear in the client-side
      DOM-tree, so the "only one `<main>` per DOM-tree"-rule can be fulfilled 
  - as there is no `<layout>` html-tag, I falsly used `<main>` tags for that, as it seemed more descriptive than `<div>`
    - instead, to make layout layers more descriptive you can use accessibility attributes
    like `<div role="region" aria-label="Main/MDX Layout">`


3. **menues and navbars are lists**

Here is another accessibility (and code organization) structure I was ignorant
of:

Navbars usually contain `<a>` tags to different sub pages of your website.
Instead of just stacking them as siblings one after another inside a `<div>`,
place them in `<li>` tags in a `<ul>`. This way it is clear to the screen reader
that
- they are basically a
navigation menu sitting at the same layer, 
- belonging together, 
- and having a clear start and endpoint,
- even when they have more complex menu nestings.

Ok, you are ready for the first components, let's go!


---

### <a id="header-and-footer" href="#main-building">Header & Footer</a>

The header component on its own is simple. Just follow the structure and comments.

```javascript title="/src/components/Header.js"
import Link from "next/link"; // make sure to import and use NextJS-specific tags like <Link>

export default function Header({}){
return (
    <header className="..."> // reminder: you can find all tailwind-classes in my source code on github
      <nav> // "navbar" often gets used synonymously with "header", but it's just one of headers possible childs. wrap it.
        <div> // this div exists for tailwindcss purposes only 
          <Link href="/"> // common practice: distinguish the main logo from the rest of the navigation links           
            <h1>LeonAndersen</h1>
          </Link>
          <ul> // wrap the other navigation items into a ul
            <li>
              <Link href="/about"> // you can set internal links already
                About
              </Link> // this is a link to another page
            </li>
            <li>
              <button> // this is a button that opens a form
                Subscribe
              </button>
              <SubscribeForm/> // SubscribeForm logic is explained later
            </li>
          </ul>
          <Menu/> // this component only appears on smaller screen sizes and is explained later
        </div>
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
};
```
The Footer component is almost the same.

```javascript title="/src/components/Footer.js"
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Footer (){
  return (
    <footer>
      <nav> // eventhough navbar is mostly associated with the header, navigation links in the footer are also usually a navbar
        <div>
          <Link href="/">
            <h1>LeonAndersen</h1>
          </Link>
          <ul>
            <li> // instead of "About", I link to the Imprint page (obligation in germany)
              <Link href="/imprint">
                Imprint
              </Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <button>
                Subscribe
              </button>
                <SubscribeForm/>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div> // on smaller screensizes this ul replaces the upper one 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link href="/imprint">
                Imprint
              </Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </footer>
  );
};


```

---

### <a id="layout" href="#main-building">Layout</a>
Now that you have `Header` and `Footer`, you can build the NextJS `Layout` component.
It is also pretty simple and self explanatory:

```javascript title="/src/components/Layout.js"
import Footer from "./Footer";
import Header from "./Header";

export default function Layout ({ children }){
  return (
    <div role="region" aria-label="Main Layout"> // css purpose, otherwise use react fragment
      <Header /> // insert Header and Footer
      {children} // explanation below
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};

```
What might get a little tricky to understand is the`{ children }` prop. It is
built into React and represents all the content that you wrap inside of a
components tag. Component-wrapped children props get auto-passed upwards and are
accessible as soon as you type `children` into the parents props-destructuring `({ })`.

As you can see below, inside of a NextJS project, the `Layout` component is
wrapped around some other essential layers within the `MyApp` component.


```javascript  title="/src/pages/_app.js"
import Layout from "../components/Layout";
import Head from "next/head";
import "../styles/globals.css"; // NextJS parallel to attaching a stylesheet to a vanilla JS HTML head

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <> // react fragment
      <Layout>
        <Head> // set the default browsertab title for all pages that you don't give another specific head title
          <title>LeonAndersen</title>
        </Head>
        <MDXProvider  components={mdxComponents}> // covered in the MDX focused article I mentioned earlier, just know this exists
          <Component {...pageProps} /> // this is where the individual pages and their props "dock into" the app
        </MDXProvider>
      </Layout>
    </>
  );
}
```
Congrats, now you also understand `_app.js`.

---

### <a id="homefeed" href="#main-building">HomeFeed</a>

Just like in [the NextJS docs tutorial](), you want the index page to act as
a feed with previews of your articles. For this you need a `HomeFeed` component and a
metadata utility component in a separate file.

First, make sure you write metadata in frontmatter format at the very top of your articles,
like this:

```mdx title="/src/pages/posts/nextjs-blog-tutorial-2024.mdx" caption=""
---
title: 'How to Code a Blog in 2024 (with MDX in Next 14 Pages-Routing)'
headtitle: '2024 NextJS Pages Blog Tutorial'
date: '2024-01-02'
readingTime: '22min'
preview: 'The step-by-step process of how you can build a blog-website just like this.
Using React, Tailwind, NextJS, MDX and MailChimp.'
---
```

Next, parse this metadata into a `getFeedData` component in your utility file.
This component returns an array `[{},{},{},...]` from all the posts, sorted by
date, with one object per post. Each object contains key-value pairs of the slug
and the frontmatter metadata out of the .mdx files.

```javascript title="/src/utils/getFeedData.js" 
import fs from "fs"; // needed for fetching filenames from the filesystem
import path from "path"; // needed for defining postsDirectory
import matter from "gray-matter";

// ensures the path is always correct relative to the root of your project
const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), "src/pages/posts");

export function getFeedData() {
  // get all .mdx file names from /posts
  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);
  const allPostsData = fileNames.map((fileName) => {
    // remove ".mdx" from file name to get slug
    const slug = fileName.replace(/\.mdx$/, "");

    // converts .mdx filecontent as string for gray-matter processing
    const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName);
    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf8");

    // use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section
    const matterResult = matter(fileContents);

    // return the data combined with the slug
    return {
      slug,
      ...matterResult.data,
    };
  });
  // sort posts by date
  return allPostsData.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.date < b.date) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return -1;
    }
  });
}

```

Then finally you import `getFeedData` into your Homepage and populate the feed. 

```js title="/src/pages/index.js"
import Link from "next/link";
import Date from "../components/date"; // needed for date formatting
import { getFeedData } from "../utils/getFeedData.js";

export async function getStaticProps() { // why here, not in getFeedData? and check the rest
  const feedData = await getFeedData();
  return {
    props: {
      feedData,
    },
  };
}


export default function Home({ feedData }) {
  return (
    <main>
      <ul> // a feed is a list. Each .map iteration step creates a new li aka a new post preview
        {feedData.map(({ slug, date, readingTime, title, preview }) => (
          <li key={slug}> // in React, dynamically created lis need unique identifiers, to be managed properly in case of state changes
            <Link href={`/posts/${slug}`} >
              <h2>
                {title} // use jsx to pass the data directly to its target destination
              </h2>
              <h3>
                <Date dateString={date} /> &nbsp;- &nbsp;{readingTime}
              </h3>
              <p>{preview}</p>
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Remember: We are using .mdx files directly as pages in this setup, so we don't
need the usual `[id].js` file with `getStaticRoutes` for parsing vanilla markdown files as
pages. That's why the `getFeedData.js` file is also a lot simpler than in most NextJS
tutorials.

### <a id="responsive-design" href="#main-building">Responsive Design</a>

In Tailwind, the breaking points are css mediaqueries pointing in one direction:
from smaller to bigger screen sizes. This means unprefixed classes like `flex`
apply to all sizes, but prefixed classes `sm:flex` apply to the specified
breakpoint *and above*.

Because of this, it makes sense to start the positioning part of the styling
from the smallest screens (simulate via chrome devtools F12) and work your way
upward from there. 

>This way you set the similarities for all sizes first and then only add the differences via breakpoints.

I made the mistake to just draft the desktop screen design in Photoshop
beforehand, so I also started with desktop styling. After I was done with that,
I realized I had to redo much of the work and start over from mobile screen
size.

<Image src={anakin}  width="20%" alt="a meme of anakin skywalker realizing he forgot to start mobile first"/>

So you better draft out the mobile design beforehand aswell, so you can start
from there. Tipp: Check how the websites you chose to model behave in mobile
screens, to get a feel for the styling. 

**Wax on Wax off:** Each time you make styling changes, check for any wierd
misalignments in all of the dev tools screen sizes over and over again. I often
stumbled upon meaningful styling problems, by testing the edgecases this way.
The sooner you find them the better. 

Positioning is one of the major parts of responsive design, so if you are having
problems with that, also make sure to check out [my article]() on positioning in
general.

**Custom Breaking Points:** Don't be afraid to create custom breaking points in
Tailwind. At first I tried to force myself to only use the default breaking
points, but sometimes there are misalignments, that can only be fixed this way.
Make use of the tools at your fingertips.

### <a id="" href="#main-building"></a>
**Menu Component**

Instead of using a premade menu component from a library like shadzcn, I built my own custom menu component.
'''code with detailed comments'''

You can get creative with what kind of icon you use for the opening the burger menu. For custom icons, you should use svg format as it scales with size. Svg gets inserted into your component as a long random string (similar to opening an mp3 file in the text editor), wrapped inside an html tag. Make sure to include "blablabla" in the html tag, to signal to screen readers, that they dont have to read out the random string of the svg.
Luckily I could skip that part and use divs with radius as my circles, because my icon was so simple I could directly create it in CSS.

-- menu close timing and logic
At this point I could open the menu and request pages, but the menu stayed open, so I added this logic:

The menu also needed to be closeable by clicking the menu icon again. For this, I had to implement a both way toggle closing logic:

I encountered the problem, that the menu closed faster, than the newly requested page loaded. This way, for a few milliseconds you always saw the page you were on before opening the menu. Eventhough requested pages load way faster in build mode, it still looked a bit glitchy. To counter that, I just added a timeout of 21 milliseconds on the eventlistener. Now the menu closes a bit slower and you land directly on the new page.

-- Scrollbar Menu
The last issue left with the menu, was that when open, the scrollbar of the underlying page was still showing. (which just takes up space and confuses, because the menu itself is not scrollable) Here is how I fixed that, using access to the dom, which I haven't done sinde the beginning of my bootcamp:

-- Subscribe Components logic and Styling
Growing an email list is one of the main objectives of a blog. So I found an everpresent subscribe form in the fixed header to be a cool idea. 
To keep it a bit less in your face I only want it to be fully expanded, once clicked. Here is the logic for that:

As mentioned above, [here] you can find my guide how I set up the NextJS API to connected to MailChimp (a Newsletter Management Service).

### <a id="404" href="#main-building">404 Page Design</a>

To mix in some fun, I designed a fancy 404 page. I've always wanted to use ASCII
art and go ham with synth wave colors and gradients. This could be your chance
for experiments too! 

<Image src={design404} alt="a screenshot of my 404 page"/>

The ASCII art needed some extra formatting to get rendered properly:
- disable prettier
- linebreaks after each line
- a character at the start of each line (to keep the whitespaces before the first ascii characters)
- To make it look good with these extra charachters, I added characters all around the ascii content, which now serves as a border/ frame.

Tipp: Check out the 404 pages of your reference websites, to get a feel for a good 404.

-- font, textwrap and color etc. finetuning
Setting the font, sizes, textwrap and colors properly can take some time.

I had struggles with the font, because the current NextJS Font setup (font@next???) for some reason displays a different font than the actual OpenSans.
I would not recommend this for websites with vulnerable data, but: For now I left it in the deprecated legacy setup (legacy font setup), because differences in font completely changed the vibe, and also destroyed some alignments. For example the *expanded* subscribe form needs pixelperfect positioning to stay aligned with the *closed* "Subscribe" button.

If you read this on desktop, you can test right now, how well the "subscribe" text is staying in place, both in open and closed state. If it is well aligned, you've got another reason to type in your best email and subscribe.

Size matters! For most of the process, I had all text one or two (Tailwind-) sizes bigger. After a while I noticed a feeling as if I was working on a device for elders or toddlers. You know these phones with giant buttons? I compared fontsizes with my reference websites, and I realized, that I had taken readability one step too far. So I sized down. It made a GIANT difference: Finally, I feel sleek as Apple. 

All of the page content lives in the middle 1/3 within a frame that is set by the elements in the header and footer. The clearer the page content fills up to this frame, the cleaner the overall vibe. (img vs fuzzy line endings: imprint vs feed vs post)
I tried different ways to do that and learned the following:

- bindestrich can come too many lines and is too hard to read, so i cannot take that for post content, nor even for the article previews on the feed page. I would not know where to actually use that.
- text balance creates way too much random space in between, unfortunately it cannot be finetuned so it looked wierd even on bigger text chunks
it only really works with walls of text that are not as important, just as the imprint page (sorry lawyers)
-- i also took it for the feed page, because here the line endings are especially fuzzy, because there is not that much text
- medium and substack have none of these wraps for their articles so I figured it is fine to keep the posts all natural

### <a id="" href="#main-building"></a>
I had the main colors set from the beginning. I use a mix of Tailwinds amazing
default classes, but also created a few custom colors. For details like the
Subscribe form below or my 404 page, I experimented alot with different color
variations until I was happy. The main lesson for me is to not use too many
different colors at once. I would say the only reason I can have 3!!! different
main brand colors plus 2 more for details, is because everything else is gray.

-- headtitles staticpages 
Head titles become the title shown in the browser tab. You could keep it minimalistic and only show "Your Website Name" at each different subpage. But it is way more professional and a better user experience, to render the individual title of each subpage that you are on ("Blog Post About Special Topic", "About", "Contact" etc.) You can just write them into the head tags of your mdx pages like this:

I have not found a way to automate putting the title into the headtag yet. But it might not even make sense anyways, because the title is often too long, in which case you need an even shorter version of it.

### <a id="favicon" href="#main-building">Favicon</a>

A small but important detail is to set your favicon - the icon of
your blog that gets shown in the browser tab and in searchengine results. 

If you don't set it, you let the browser show a default icon. This looks like
your website is broken, offline, or out of date. You don't need much to look
professional.

### <a id="left-out" href="#main-building">What I Left Out</a>

**ID page:** I started learning NextJS by following [this]
and [this] tutorial. They don't use mdx as pages, so I first also built an ID
page. It acts as a template that fetches all your blog posts as different pages
and sets their slug as their path (slug = id = blog-post-title-dashed). For this
we use NextJSs `getStaticPaths` feature. I can recommend to check out how it
roughly works, but it is easier to leave it out to properly render your custom
MDX formatting.


colorttheme I built a beautiful colortheme matching the blog-colors
myself using THIS tool. But unfortunately after tons of hours spent and an
annoying Microsoft Azure publishing process, it was not compatible with the
current version of VS Codium. So I left my baby behind to keep moving with the
stuff that matters.

--- re-Setup nextjs linux vs macbook m1 incl. git sorting Sidestory about
workload management and Linux: At some point I lost track of my different git
branches and trimmed everything away except for my main branch with the latest
merges. I then swiped my local repository, so I could download and re-install
only my main branch. Unfortunately, NextJS did not properly run after that. I
thought I'd had to manually copy file by file from github to find where I messed
up. So I thought, in that case I could use that restart to setup linux and
rebuild the project there. I definitely learned some things, but honestly it was
a waste of 2-3 days. There were so many obstacles on the way to get it running,
that I decided to postpone my linux journey to sometime else, once I can afford
a personal Linux Mentor. Luckily one of my best friends offered to lend his M1
chipped MacBook to me. After setting up VS Codium and pulling my repository from
github, it immediately worked. The reason for NextJS crashes can be old
hardware. However, the bigger moral of this: Don't learn coding + typing + vim +
linux(lol) at the same time.

--- 404 redirect In the Webninjas NextJS tutorial, they build an automatic
redirect from the 404 back to home. I tried that aswell, but it comes with
problems: 1. If you click towards another page in the meantime, you will get
redirected to home shortly afterwards. 2. You might confuse the user, about what
happened, if he did not notice the 404 sign in between the redirect. 3. The user
will not have the chance to sufficiently marvel at your beautiful 404 page. Just
do it like google: Present a link that the user can manually click for
redirection. Done.

--- scrollbar dark, header/footer-passend I love the brave browser, but on
windows it has a bright scrollbar even in darkmode. Let's say it politely: It
interferes with the design. I tried a few different ways to make it dark, but
nothing looked that great. I might catch up on that later, but for now there are
more important things. At least the mac scrollbar looks great with the blog.

--- some styling details (variations, gradients, multifont, too many colors, too
many hover and change effects) I tried some crazy hover effects and multifont,
but that was just too much, let's keep it minimalistic.

_From here on most is just documentation/ journaling insight for myself. I want
to share these notes here though to keep everything at one place, and maybe you
get some things out of this aswell._

<br/>
## <a id="insights" href="#toc"> Learning Process Insights</a>
**Not all tutorials are perfect:** I had a few times,
where I was super confused because a tutorial said something that was contrary
to what I already know. For some moments I doubted myself, but luckily I found
some ways to test and verify that actually I was right. Not always of course. Be
aware, be relaxed. 

**Balance of reading details vs filtering fast:** One challenge I had was to
balance filtering fast through tons of content, with also not missing important
details. - Once you found some resources with seeming high quality, take your time
to understand the details. I had to learn NextJS twice, because I skipped all
details the first round. However, sometimes this can be the right approach
aswell.

**Having the right mentor is a gamechanger:** I am incredibly grateful for my
mentor Alyph Nill from ten-x-dev. Having personal support for complicated
questions is helping me so much. Through him, I also have access to knowledge
about the industry I haven't found via search engines, and there were a lot of
moments where ChatGPT etc was not enough or even misleading. I don't know where
I would be with out him. Make sure to subscribe to my newsletter, so you can get
my report about how I found a job in the industry.

**Preparation is worth the time:** At first I was insecure, if I might be
wasting time with the few hours of scoping, modeling and drafting, but I will do
that 100% again for the next project. I am pretty sure I would have wasted way
more time fooling around with CSS than with an easy tool such as Photoshop
first.

**Time spent with styling:** I was also insecure about maybe wasting time with design
experiments that went beyond my initial draft. However, there were a few things
that I just wasn't able to predict from the drafting stage. I am happy I took my
time with them, feeling confident with (Tailwind)CSS by now. Except for a little fun with the 404 page, everything was in an
appropriate range.



**Installing vs programming:** One thing that annoyed me was how much time I had
to spent just with the basic setup of elements such as mdx and syntax
highlighting. I definitely prefer the part of actually coding as opposed to
installing. However I might not get around installing any time soon, so I set
the intention of enjoying those processes and maybe even finding ways to make
them faster. We will see.

**QuestionStorming technique:** For challenges like finding a way to use MDX in
a different way than described on the NextJS docs, I used a written
rubberducking method I usually use for personal decisions. I was excited that it
works with coding too, so I will probably write an article about that method in
the future.

**Don't stress to learn too many things at once:** At one point I was learning
Vim and Git and touch-typing (+ a new keyboard-layout) and NextJS and CSS and
Linux trying to implement everything at once. That slowed me down, and I felt
like an idiot 90% of the time, so I took some dedicated time just for typing and
Vim and I also gave up on Linux until I can afford a Linux mentor. I once read
that humans learn best when they feel like idiots 15% of the time, feels right
haha.

**Cycling between style and logic:** I tried to separate styling-commits from
logic-commits, but that is not always possible. I would say the most natural way
is a constant cycling between them. 

- commit expectations
  - <span className='text-red-500'>logic, logic, logic, logic, </span><span className='text-violet-500'>styling, styling, styling, styling, </span> etc
- commit reality 
  - <span className='text-orange-500'>multiple styling and logic fixes mixed,</span> <span className='text-red-500'>logic,</span> <span className='text-violet-500'>styling,</span> <span className='text-orange-500'>mixed,</span> etc


**A few self explanatory oneliners:**

- Make it work. Make it clean. Make it fast.
- Use a Youtube blocker to limit your time in the dev-fluencer echochamber.
- Days of stuckness are preparation for wins.


**Write docs to boost your confidence:** I was annoyed when my mentor gave me
the task to write blog posts about the building process. That sounded so boring,
I just wanted to jump to the next project (I still want to). But going through
all of the code once again and explaining it my own words, solidified the skills
and knowledge more than I expected. It shines the light on your blindspots,
forces you to go a level deeper, to clarify and also connect the knowledge to a
bigger picture. It's a bit painful, but I feel way more confident about my
skills by now. For the next docs I will probably talk less about preparation and
philosophy though, which will make the whole process faster and more focused on the raw
code.
